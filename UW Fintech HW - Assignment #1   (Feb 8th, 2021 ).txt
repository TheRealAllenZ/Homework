Overview: Fintech Case Study 
I chose a Fintech company in perhaps the oldest of finance-sector giants- the United States Government- in both sheer scale of finances transacted, as well as expenditures undertaken on an ongoing basis, since its founding.  The “tech” portion of government has heretofore always been either nonexistent or embarrassingly outdated. 


Enter Steve Ballmer’s USA FACTS Org, a not-for-profit company merging big data, machine learning, and data visualization to refine insights into the US Government’s spending in a non-partisan, “data first”, and easy-to-access FREE (creative commons license), format for the whole world.  WOW ! 
Name:                 USAFACTS.ORG
Incorporation:         2017
Founder:                Steve Ballmer 

Ideation- USAFACTS.ORG Founding
Steve Ballmer, former Microsoft, CEO, witnessed corporate accountability, laws that punish individuals, taxes levied against persons legal and non-legal (.e.g. Corporations), but one area was sorely lacking: holding government accountable.  No metrics, before/after, or performance indicators existed (still do not) for (1) tracking, (2) defining, (3) collating, and (4) scaling the massive amounts of data that the federal and states’ governments output annually. 
Mr. Ballmer created USAFACTS.ORG to simply and intelligently align ALL government-published data into one central datastore for the world to see. 
Funding
1. 100% Steve Ballmer funded; 
2. NO grants, donations, and/or outside funding permitted; 
3. No Board of Advisors or external governance.  
Focus: What specific financial problems? 
Non-Partisan, non-biased, USA Government revenues and spending.  
Company’s Intended Customer?
The public. More specifically, anyone with an internet connection. However, in the abstract I believe USAFACTS to be a great contender to future-proof the United States as a functioning government entity in the world.  Concretely, its mission protects future generations from potential disastrous and ruinous fiscal policies at present that could prove catastrophic to future Americans.  
Competition: none
USAFacts operates in the segment alone. The saying goes that we don’t learn until we are forced to do so. With spending, interest rates, government programs, and monetary policy at unprecedented levels, we will truly not know today’s impacts until much later. 
USAFacts monopolized the entire government accountability sector even before it became an industry.  Assuming USAFacts persists, there will be no organization in the future that can compete: 
1. USAFacts is not-for-profit; 
2. USAFacts will have years if not decades of finished data; 
3. Is self-funded; 
4. Does not need or accept outside funding;
5. Is currently working on an API for public use and implementation;
6. Assuming USAFacts achieves its mission; will obviate the need for its own existence.
Current Technologies Deployed
* Python, PostgreSQL, REST API, AWS S3/Boto3                 (back-end) 
* NodeJS, Express, EC2                                                (architecture / access) 
* Hadoop, or Storm                                                (big data / BI output) 
* AWS                                                                 (cloud infrastructure) 
* Power BI / Tableau  or similar *(UNCONFIRMED)                 (interfact - front-end) 


What Domain Does This Company Reside?
USAFacts fills a broad niche, I would say cutting-edge niche of fintech: Regulatory Technology, and a sub-division thereof- Government Oversight. Within RegTech, the tech has been a one-way focus; companies complying with government and regulatory requirements. 

USAFacts seem to take this same niche and reverse the direction of compliance to instead, hold government accountable to its constituents. 


Major trends and innovations over the last 5-10 years?
Quite a lot. Institutional players (JP Morgan, Deloitte, TD, etc…) has taken the greatest advantage of the automation, digitization, and artificial intelligence of RegTech strides made over the last 5-10 years. 

Broadly, RegTech functions is broken up into: 
1. Regulatory reporting; 
2. Risk Management; 
3. Identity Management & Control; 
4. Compliance; 
5. Transaction Monitor. 


Other Major Companies In This Domain? 
1. ACA Compliance Group; 
2. Accuity; 
3. Actico; 
4. Acuminor; 
5. BIG ID; 
6. CaseWare; 
7. Cognitive+; 
8. Datactics; 
9. Digio; 
10. Kaizen Reporting ; 
11. And many more 


What Has Been the Business Impact of This Company So Far?
It is too early to tell. With 28-35 full-time employees, USAFacts is the only company currently synthesizing and producing a full 10K (SEC annual filing) for the United States Government as a whole. 

With long-term data, and operably comparable numbers, the data trends can become more clear.  The multitude of applications, reporting, citable data from this project will hopefully become relevant going forward in state-wide initiatives, congressional reviews, judicial hearings, and other official government and non-governmental applications. 


What Are Some of the Core Metrics that Companies use in this Domain?
So far, there is no STATIC KPI used in the industry.  However, common measures include: 
1. Regulatory dollars saved - per incident, or per time period (over a course of years); 
2. ROI - like any other project or departmental funding within companies, ROI is calculated intra-organizational in areas of
   1. How much less HR - human capital is saved; 
   2. How fewer compliance events - or red-flag - events occur; 
   3. How much less companies pay for lawyers to “fix’ issues ex-post vs ex-ante; 


How is Your Company Performing Relative to Competitors in this Domain
Again, USAFacts is unique in its market occupation and purported function. The long-term impacts may well be more difficult to measure as Steve Ballmer reminisced on several interviews; the goal of USAFacts is to improve; 
   1. Social standing among each other; 
   2. Provide accessible and non-biased data; 
   3. Forge a vector of “closeness” among American not observed for a long time.


Advisory Role: What Would I Advise USAFacts To Do/Pursue?
Provided that all other for-profit organizations measure their success based on stock price, revenue, growth, market-share, saturation, and the “x-factor,” it would be disingenuous and in fact, inaccurate to measure USAFacts to the same standards provided; 
   1. USAFacts is not-for-profit; 
   2. Is Self-Funded; 
   3. And has no mandate to produce profit.


Likening USAFacts to existing organizations yields its structure and purpose to be more closely aligned with not-for-profit and/or non-profit organizations. (NFP and NPO, respectively). However, NFP and NPOs are likewise dissimilar to USAFacts, conventionally measuring “success” by: 
   1. Dollars raised; 
   2. Memberships growns; 
   3. Visitors used; 
   4. People served; 
   5. And Cost-basis growth or decline. 


Again, even NFP and NPO KPI or metrics prove incongruent.  I would propose the USAFacts, given the singular nature of their mission and the lack of competition in the space - to do the following; 
   1. Use Big Data to drive collection and analysis of public citation for their 10K reports, Covid19 data, education-by-state, poverty-rate (to name a few) broadly, “data output” in the universe of internet, scholarly, court, congress, government, and private uses (TRACK EVERYTHING); 
   2. As soon as humanly possible, create a robust and cross-platform compatible API to aid in #1’s tracking of their output tracing and sourcing; 
   3. Finally, create a culture through media, sponsorships, collaborations (with social media small, medium & large content creators) to spread the word about USAFacts’ mission, objectives, and future.
